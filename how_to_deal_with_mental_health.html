        <li>Use open-ended questions to show you care, like “What’s going on for you right now?”</li>
        <li>Offer a walk or physical activity to help reduce stress</li>
        <li>Respect their space, but remain emotionally available</li>
        <li>Help them identify their triggers and suggest healthy coping strategies</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>For Adults</h3>

        <li>Maintain a calm tone and body language — avoid escalating</li>
        <li>Ask if they’d like to talk or need space — respect their boundaries</li>
        <li>Use grounding techniques: suggest deep breathing or naming things they see</li>
        <li>Encourage seeking professional support if emotions remain overwhelming</li>
        <li>Validate their feelings without minimizing them (e.g., “That sounds incredibly difficult”)</li>
        <li>Be a consistent, non-judgmental presence during and after difficult moments</li>
      </ul>
